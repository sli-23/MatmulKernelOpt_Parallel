The benchmark analysis reveals that Tensor Parallel (TP) and Expert Parallel (EP) MoE implementations shows distinct scaling characteristics influenced by batch size, model dimensions, and top-k routing. TP demonstrates scalability for large batch sizes and models by effectively distributing parameters across devices, thereby mitigating memory constraints and maintaining computational efficiency even as routing complexity increases. In contrast, EP experiences performance degradation with increased batch sizes and higher top-k values due to intensive inter-process communication, making it more suitable for moderate model sizes and lower batch sizes with simpler routing schemes.
