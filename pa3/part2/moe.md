DeepSeek-V3, with significantly more parameters (471B vs. 6.6B) than LLaMA-7B, demonstrates several key benefits of Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures: it activates only a small fraction of its parameters for each input, distributes specialized knowledge among experts, and scales more effectively than dense models. While MoE models demand considerable resources during training, they can still deliver better performance per training dollar due to their sparse activation, and they offer an adaptable compute footprint by adjusting top-k experts for different resource constraints. In conclusion, DeepSeek-V3â€™s MoE structure underscores how models can grow to large parameter counts without the prohibitive compute scaling typical of dense approaches.
