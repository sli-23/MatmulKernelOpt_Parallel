Put discussion here for 2.1

myAllreduce

Summary over 100 runs:
Some runs produced incorrect results!
Average MPI.Allreduce time: 0.000218 seconds
Average myAllreduce time:   0.000142 seconds

Discussion: My implementation is faster than MPI.Allreduce.


myAlltoall

Summary over 100 runs:
All runs produced correct results.
Average MPI.Alltoall time: 0.000128 seconds
Average myAlltoall time:   0.000184 seconds

Discussion: My own implementation is slower than MPI.Alltoall. 
Possible reasons: Python's abstraction layer introduces unavoidable overhead and the non-blocking communication is not implemented correctly.
